## Adapted template in LaTex of the PhD manuscript of Sorbonne Université

Here is an adaptation in LaTex of the Sorbonne Université PhD manuscript template. The original template in Word can be found [here](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/le-doctorat/demarches-administratives/soutenance). 


### About the template

Right and left margins are different by default: inside margins are bigger than outside margins to ensure that text isn't obscured by the binding, when the manuscript is printed.

## How to format this manuscript for you
* by default this template is set up in french, i.e. the names of the table of contents (TOC), bibliography,... are in french. You can change that easily by commenting the line **\usepackage[francais]{babel}** to use the english version
